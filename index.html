      "Summer Landscape" - Marv P.

    This is my rendition of Summer Landscape by Ilya Repinâ€“ originally painted in 1879. I chose not to include the woman in the white dress because I wanted to focus on the actual landscape itself and truly capture the foilage in the scene. This particular remake of Summer Landscape uses geometric shapes to reflect elements from the original painting.
